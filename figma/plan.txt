fix yb display
about page

figure out picture upload flow
different for qualified yb photographers vs random students
yb photographers can just continue to upload photos to herff jones

otherwise, what we need are these items:
photo file(s)
who's uploading?
quick photo context desc


homepage content. sell the site to them
- hero: show visually that this is a photo gallery with photo upload. collage with + button
"HOME OF
MEMORIES @ VPCI"
"view and upload photos year-round on vp's official photo gallery."

- 1st section
describe problems:
1. yb being a once-a-year thing.
2. limited opportunities for contribution. there's the huge filter of 'you need photography/design skills and you need to make an application and you need to do a bunch of work and adhere to all our deadlines etc.' if you want to make any contribution to the yb
3. limited representation in the yb. e.g. including enough photos of academics + 9th graders was a struggle last year because most of our photos were of gr. 10, 11, 12 ib students

- 2nd section:
how do we address these problems?
1. we're making a platform to serve students year-round.
2. any student can make regular micro-contributions through our platform.
3. students can upload their own photos, ensuring that they can make it into the yb even if they don't do clubs and aren't friends with our photographers lol

- 3rd section:
benefits
1. they could see the really nice pic in their camera roll end up in the yb
2. can view our photos digitally
3. have access to a gallery of all our photos in the first place (i think it's p fun to just look through the yb photos lol)

- 4th section:
key features:
photo upload allows any student to upload a photo that could potentially make it to the yb.
comprehensive gallery of photos, regularly updated, accessible year-round
